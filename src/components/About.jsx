        Hi, I'm Mrigesh Thakur, a tech enthusiast with a passion for developing
        applications in the MERN stack. Over the past 2 years, I've gained
        experience in this field and am eager to take on new challenges. I'm
        currently a 2nd year student pursuing a degree in Mathematics and
        Scientific Computing at NIT Hamirpur. I've had the opportunity to work
        with several startups in the past and am now excited to contribute to
        the open source community. Recently, I've been exploring the world of
        metaverse projects, where together with my friends, we created
        functional projects for various hackathons. I'm eager to continue
        exploring the limitless possibilities of the metaverse and make a
        difference in the open source community and know many new things . With
        my technical expertise, enthusiasm, and willingness to learn, I believe
        I can be a valuable addition to any team or project.
